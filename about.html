    <center><h2>benifits of online shoping</h2></center>
    <p>l. Simple to locate: Finding a product on the internet is much easier than going from store to store looking for the perfect product or size. Order your groceries online and have them delivered to a convenient pickup location (Click and Collect) or a Collect in Store counter.
</p>
        2. Cheaper goods: Some things are significantly cheaper online since some offers are only available to internet customers. There are numerous easy ways to browse products and compare prices before you shop online.
<p>   
        3. Save time and effort: You donâ€™t want to waste time waiting and browsing the aisles during peak shopping hours only to discover that what you sought is already out of stock. This issue is easily solved by ordering online and having your things delivered to the closest and most convenient pickup location.
